== Usage

> require 'css_reader'
> css = CSSReader.new("test.css")
> css.append("secondary.css")
> css.save("production.css", :compress => true)

The above commands will generate new file that merges the files passed to the class in order. Also, and "@import" statement is processed inline and is also inserted in the order it is encountered recursively throughout the CSS. In this example the file has also been yui-compressed.

== Dependencies

Requires the yui-compressor gem:

> gem install -r yui-compressor

== Specs

A simple but comprehensive rSpec suite is provided for quality assurance purposes.

> spec css_reader_spec.rb

== Todo

Convert this into a gem that can be run via command line?

== Disclaimer

This is really crude but useful. You could easily crash it if you placed an @import statement in a fashion to create an infinite loop. Don't do that! :)
